# Client Server Chat Program
A client-server chat program written for CS 372 - Computer Networks at Oregon State University. The purpose of the project was to explore the process of transmitting data via a socket connection. 

The project is built in Python and utilizes the socket module. There is one server, which communicates with only one client at a time. The client and server may communicate as long as the socket connections are open. 

# Lessons Learned 
- Learned about communication between a server and client using sockets 
- Learned how to create a client-server connection using Python
